## Analyze International Debt Statistics

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to analyzing international debt data provided by The World Bank. In this comprehensive notebook, we delve into the intricate world of debt economics for developing countries. By exploring this data, we aim to gain valuable insights into various aspects of global economics and financial trends.

## Introduction
Debt is a multifaceted financial instrument that plays a significant role not only in the lives of individuals but also on a national and international scale. Beyond personal finance, countries utilize debt to stimulate economic growth, fund infrastructure projects, and manage their fiscal responsibilities. The World Bank, as a key international institution, provides financial assistance to countries through debt arrangements.

## Objective
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of The World Bank's international debt data, focusing on developing countries. By harnessing the power of SQL queries, we aim to uncover valuable insights into this complex economic landscape. Through a series of queries, we address critical questions such as the total debt owed, the country with the highest debt, average debt amounts, and the distribution of debt across various indicators.

## Analysis Steps
Connecting to the Database: We establish a connection to the international_debt database to retrieve the first ten rows of the international_debt table.

Distinct Countries: We explore the dataset to count the total number of distinct countries present, shedding light on the scope of our analysis.

Distinct Debt Indicators: By identifying and listing distinct debt indicators, we gain insight into the various financial categories countries incur debt in.

Total Debt: We calculate the sum of debt owed by all developing countries, offering a macroscopic view of the overall financial situation.

Country with the Highest Debt: Through a query, we pinpoint the country that holds the highest amount of debt and provide context for this significant figure.

Average Debt Across Indicators: We calculate and analyze the average debt for each debt indicator, offering a nuanced view of financial distribution.

Country with the Highest Principal Repayments: By isolating the highest principal repayment, we uncover an insightful aspect of long-term debt scenarios.

Most Common Debt Indicator: We identify the most common debt indicator among all countries, providing a snapshot of prevailing financial challenges.

## Conclusion
This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding international debt trends and patterns. By exploring the SQL queries and analyses presented, users can gain a deeper understanding of global economics and how debt shapes the financial destinies of developing countries.
